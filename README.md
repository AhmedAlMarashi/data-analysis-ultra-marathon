## Overview

This project analyzes ultra marathon race data from the USA in 2020, focusing on 50km and 50mi events. Using Python, pandas, and seaborn, it explores trends in athlete performance by gender, age group, and season.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (age, season, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualizations of performance trends
- Insights into fastest groups and conditions

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all analysis and visualizations
- `TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv` — (ignored in git) Raw race data (not included in repo)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedAlMarashi/data-analysis-ultra-marathon.git
   ```
2. Download the dataset and place it in the project folder as `TWO_CENTURIES_OF_UM_RACES.csv`.
3. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Install required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Example Visualizations
